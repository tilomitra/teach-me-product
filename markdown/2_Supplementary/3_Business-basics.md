# Business basics

*Many of the products you know and love are mainstream successes not only because they are well designed, but also because the companies behind have figured out a viable business model to sustain and grow their efforts. Beyond just the end product, these companies have developed thriving businesses that allow them to design, build, sell, and support their products. As a PM, you will be making and guiding numerous product decisions that will influence your product’s outcome, and as a result your company's success. As was mentioned in module 1, it's important for you to be the voice of the business amongst your product team.*

*For most PM roles, you don't need an MBA - it's the mindset that counts. By understanding business fundamentals and their applicability to your company and product, you can guide your team to make better product decisions. Don't forget, even the best designed products are not guaranteed to succeed in the market. Additional factors, especially those in the business domain, play a part. Some of these factors are in your control (e.g., pricing, promotion, etc.) while others are not (e.g., competition, customer preference, etc.). We cover some business jargon and fundamentals in this module. You may not encounter these outright in your day-to-day as a PM; however, learning about them helps you get into a frame of mind where you consider business implications.*

## Business fundamentals

### What is a business?

Simply put, businesses are entities that provide goods or services to customers in return for money, and usually in an attempt to profit. As a PM, you play a part in your businesses success since you are an integral part of product development process.

### Stakeholders

A business’ stakeholder is anyone that has an interest in or is impacted by the business - this includes internal (e.g., management, employees, etc.) and external (e.g. customers, suppliers, shareholders, etc.) individuals or groups.

Why is this important? As a PM, you will need to routinely consider your immediate stakeholders, such as your users or cross-functional partners; however, you may also need to give thought to broader business stakeholders such as investors or suppliers. For instance, if you're a PM at an early-stage startup, investor targets will likely play a role in your product efforts. If user growth was a desired outcome for the next two quarters by your investors, you would likely be focusing efforts towards that. Similarly, if you were a PM at a food delivery venture such as [UberEATS](https://ubereats.com), suppliers in the form of local restaurants would likely be a key stakeholder that you would frequently consider.

### How businesses define themselves

Common to most businesses is that they have the following:

-   **A mission** - why they exist
-   **A vision** - what they want to accomplish in the future
-   **Values** - what their guiding principles are regarding how they act
-   **Goals** - what general achievements they want to accomplish in working towards their vision
-   **Objectives** - what specific, measurable things they want to achieve in a given timeframe
-   **A strategy** - how do they plan to make progress towards their vision

For a business, it's important to have these defined. It requires that company leaders are thoughtful upfront about what they want to do and have a sense of direction for how they'll know when they're successful. These factors help ensure alignment across the organization - including what they want to achieve, what culture they to cultivate, what type of people they want to hire, and so on. As a PM, it's crucial you understand these aspects for your company. This is because the product efforts and decisions you help lead should be working towards achieving the company's vision. It's worth noting that objectives and strategies are fluid and do change over time as companies learn more and try taking different approaches towards their vision. Sometimes, even your mission and vision evolves as you grow as a company.

Here's an example of the mission, vision, and goals for [Tesla](https://www.teslamotors.com/):

-   **Mission** - Accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy [source](https://www.teslamotors.com/about, Tesla - About)

-   **Vision** - Create the most compelling car company of the 21st century by driving the world’s transition to electric vehicles [source](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/0x0x494001/dd297293-ec2d-4dc5-8db4-63d491fb6bd0/Company_Overview_Q3_2011.pdf, 2011 Tesla Company Overview)

-   **Goals** - As seen in Tesla's 2011 product roadmap below, their approach towards achieving their mission was incremental goals that started with them providing a proof-point by selling the Tesla Roadster (it used the Lotus platform), then selling cheaper vehicles built on Tesla's proprietary "S" platform, and then finally moving into the mass-market with a cheaper vehicle.

## Basic financials

As a PM you don't need to be a financial wizard. It is helpful though to understand some basic financial terminology as it can come up directly or indirectly in the role.

One of the objectives of a business is to generate a **profit** - that is what you earn from customers (i.e., **revenue**) minus what is spent to do so (i.e., **costs**). Being more specific, **gross profit** is your sales revenue from your product minus the cost to make your product (e.g., salaries for the product team, hosting fees, etc.). **Net income** is the profit after not only subtracting your costs to make it, but subtracting additional items such as operating expense (e.g., sales and marketing, research and development, etc.), other expenses, interest, and taxes. Taking this one step further, the **profit margin** is the ratio of profit to costs over a time period and is often used to measure a company's financial wellbeing (i.e., all things equal, higher margins are better).

You may often hear partners in Finance or Marketing talk about the top line or the bottom line. The **top line** is the total revenue of a company while the **bottom line** refers to the net income. In the context of a software company, you may hear that sales grows the top line while other functions impact the bottom line (e.g., marketing runs a promotion that costs money). While you may not be out there selling, as a PM, you too can impact the top line by building great products that people want to use and pay for.

*[The 2015 Income Statement of Alphabet (Google's parent company) (Source: Google Finance)](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AGOOGL&fstype=ii&ei=kRqAV-iDK4er2AaU4JKwBg "Caption")*

<br>
Additionally, you may hear about:

-   **Financial statements** - "records that outline the financial activities of a business. Financial statements for businesses usually include: income statements, balance sheet, statements of retained earnings and cash flows" [source](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp?layout=infini&v=5A&orig=1&adtest=5A, Investopedia - Financial Statements).

-   **Cash flow** - this is the difference in the money coming in and out of a company. Ideally you want to be cash flow positive (i.e., more money is coming in than is going out); however, at times you are willing to be cash flow negative to succeed in the longer term.

-   **Fiscal Year** - the period used by "a company... for accounting purposes and preparing financial statements; ... \[it\] may or may not be the same as a calendar year" [source](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp?layout=infini&v=5A&adtest=5A, Investopedia - Fiscal Year).

-   **Quarter** - "a quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) is a three-month period on a financial calendar that acts as a basis for the reporting of earnings and the paying of dividends" [source](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quarter.asp?layout=infini&v=5A&orig=1&adtest=5A, Investopedia - Quarter).

-   **"The P&L" (Profit and Loss Statement)** - "a financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs and expenses incurred during a specific period of time, usually a fiscal quarter or year" [source](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plstatement.asp?layout=infini&v=5A&orig=1&adtest=5A, Investopedia - P&L Statement).

-   **P&L Responsibility** - this means you are responsible for the net income of your unit or business. For example, the General Manager of a business unit in a larger company or the CEO of a startup would both have P&L responsibility. Some PMs may also have P&L responsibility for their products. This usually entails allocating resources to grow revenue, setting sales targets, cutting costs, etc.

Knowing what the items above are helps you to collaborate with cross-functional partners since you know what they're talking about. It also helps you understand some factors that influence company priorities. For instance, if you're a PM at a [public company](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp?o=40186&l=dir&qsrc=999&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&ap=investopedia.com&layout=infini&v=5A&orig=1&adtest=5A) many of your product targets are likely to be tied to your company's fiscal calendar and quarters.

This may sound extremely straight-forward and you may be rolling your eyes, but you would be surprised at how many aspiring PMs I've seen that have overlooked business considerations entirely in interviews or decision-making. Yes, you want to design wonderful product experiences and put your customers first, but at the same time, you need to remember that you're running a business as well. The ultimate goal is to create value for customers (utility, entertainment, etc.) while capturing value for the business (profit) so you can sustain and ideally grow your efforts. So be sure to ask yourself what the impact is to the business both long and short term when considering decisions. At times you may be willing to take a negative hit financially in the short term, but if there are no prospects for long term benefits, you’d better have a compelling reason as to why you still want to go forward with something.

For instance, Facebook was started in 2004, it eventually started generating revenue along the way as it casually experimented with ads, and in 2009 it became cash flow positive for the first time. After IPOing in 2012, it really took its monetization efforts up a notch and in 2015 had ~$17.9B in revenue and ~$3.7 in profit [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Facebook, Wikipedia - History of Facebook) [source](http://investor.fb.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=952040, Facebook Investor Relations). They weathered those years without revenue because they had multiple investors funding them who believed in the potential of their strategy to get a large engaged user base first, and then monetize it. On the other hand, if you neglect building a sustainable business, minding your finances, and figuring out how much customers actually like your product, you can end up in situations such as [Fab](http://fab.com/), which was valued at $900M and ended up selling for what's rumored to be $15M [source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/fab-com-is-sold-in-billion-dollar-darling-s-spectacular-rise-and-fall, Bloomberg - Onetime Internet Darling Fab.com Sells for Paltry Sum) [source](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-billion-dollar-startup-fab-died-2015-2, Business Insider - How red-hot startup Fab raised $330 million and then went bust).

## Basic concepts and analyses

To provide you with a starting point, the following are concepts or analyses that you may come across:

-   **Metric** - "Parameters or measures of quantitative assessment used for measurement, comparison or to track performance or production" (e.g., \# of clicks on a button, time a user spent covering over an item, \# of landing page views, etc.) [source](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp?layout=infini&v=5A&adtest=5A, Investopedia - Metrics).

-   **Key performance indicator (KPI)** - Metrics "used to determine a company's progress in achieving its strategic and operational goals, and also to compare a company's finances and performance against other businesses within its industry" [source](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kpi.asp?layout=infini&v=5A&adtest=5A, Investopedia - KPI). It why it's important to select the right KPIs [here](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/measure-choose-smarter-kpis-incentives/).

-   **Return on investment (ROI)** - A ratio that " the amount of return on an investment relative to the investment’s cost" [source](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp?layout=infini&v=5A&orig=1&adtest=5A, Investopedia - ROI). This ratio helps us understand whether the cost is worth the reward.

-   **Cost-benefit analysis** - This is similar to ROI and is used to compare input against output. Specifically, the "benefits of a given situation or business-related action are summed and then the costs associated with taking that action are subtracted" [source](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-benefitanalysis.asp?layout=infini&v=5A&adtest=5A, Investopedia - Cost-benefit Analysis).

-   **Break-even analysis** - used to "determine the point at which revenue received equals the costs associated with receiving the revenue" [source](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakevenanalysis.asp?o=40186&l=dir&qsrc=999&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&ap=investopedia.com&layout=infini&v=5A&orig=1&adtest=5A, Investopedia - Break-even Analysis).

-   **Financial model** - A tool used to project the financial implications (e.g., possible sales, costs, etc.) of a product or project. You generally model possible outcomes using a combination of known data (e.g., we have 1 million users) and assumptions (e.g., we predict 10% of our current 1 million users will pay for the new feature). Models can help you consider whether something is worth pursuing in and at what point it would make sense. They do have their limitations though - even the most rigorous models can fall apart in real life because behaviour can be hard to predict, especially if you're trying to model new domains where there isn't much historical data. Imagine in 2006 trying to predict Smartphone sales for 2010 - this was before the iPhone was launched in 2007 and became a bigger success than most predicted!

To reiterate, many PMs in their career may never compute a formal ROI or conduct a break-even analysis. That said, you may interact with leaders or partners that refer to these items and expect you to understand what they're talking about. More importantly, by understanding the basics of these analyses you can employ them as part of your mindset when making decisions. For instance, you may consider:

-   Consider when the possible benefits of a feature match can outweigh the investment of building and launching it (i.e., break-even)
-   The relative effort against the expected benefit (i.e., cost-benefit) of three new possible features to decide on the one that would give you the best relative outcome

## The business case

A business case is the rationale for why a new effort, such as a new product, feature, or project, should be undertaken. Historically, [comprehensive business cases](http://www.productmanagementschool.com/w1/Product_Management_During_Business_Case_Phase) were developed prior to most significant efforts and these lengthy documents worked well with the [Waterfall approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) to software development where steps were linear and sequenced. They contained details such as market analysis, proposed product descriptions, multi-year financial projections, implementation plans, and an assessment of risks, to help guide a decision making.

Beyond investing a significant amount of time and effort, there can be drawbacks to such a rigorous approach. You do not know the answer to key questions and settle on shaky assumptions, and even with detailed financial analysis you can easily be way off from reality. Adding insult to injury, no one may actually read it and instead ask for the "two-line version." Also, the business case is just the first part, you also need to get buy-in and have key decision makers onboard with your suggestion - too much time on the business case and not enough on bringing the team along can lead to issues, especially with leadership, when it comes time to make a decision.

While such comprehensive business cases may be overkill for most efforts, **the premise of the business case is valuable for all PMs - you need to think holistically to justify and communicate whether or not to pursue an opportunity.**

I've found software companies are increasingly leaner these days when it comes to making a case for undertaking a new product effort, such as launching a new product or feature, or undertaking a big effort such as a migration of customer data from one system to another. I've personally prepared business cases to get leadership and cross-functional buy-in for everything from new Customer Support tools to full-fledged features. These business cases varied in length and rigour based on the context. When more significant decisions were to be made and needed to be communicated out to partners, these business cases were small PowerPoint presentations. Other times, with smaller less ambiguous or risky efforts, the business case could be as simple as a 10-bullet email.

What I found valuable about the process of pulling together a simple business case is:

-   It helped me more holistically think through the question at hand
-   It made me take a position to make a recommendation
-   It was a great forcing function to collaborate with partners, since I pieced aspects together with their help
-   It gave transparency to everyone involved in the decision making process about what's known and unknown

TODO! could you have one column where it's the general principles/steps listed, then a second column for a specific example? It could help make this section a bit more tangible. 

I've found it helpful to take a more iterative and incremental approach to building a business case. This means if I want to evaluate an effort, I:

1.  Start by identifying the major relevant categories that I need to explore; often they include the customer pain, customer benefit, effort, timeline, dependencies, risks, etc.

2.  Take a stab at addressing each with a few bullets based on what I know at that point

3.  Identify what I would like to know but don't

4.  Identify how I can figure these unknowns out. Can I leverage my team or partners? Do I need to connect with a few customers to answer questions around customer benefit?

5.  Prioritize my discovery of these unknowns; what is most important for me to know first? For example, if I'm unsure of the customer benefit of a potential new feature and can shed some light on this, it likely makes sense to explore that before thinking about the dependencies and resourcing required to build it.

6.  Apply judgement to gauge how thorough I need to be based on the opportunity at hand. Can I be directional (e.g., this will take a team of five engineers around four weeks) or do I need to be more specific?

7.  Share early and often. As I come to points where I feel somewhat confident that I can have a productive chat with relevant stakeholders, I connect with them. It could be a 15 minute chat to see if you're going in the right direction. This helps ensure you're bringing others along on your journey (this makes alignment on the final decision much easier!) and that you're addressing pressing questions they may have - often you'll forget to consider a vital aspect and someone else will bring it up. When sharing, try to lead with the two-line version where you clearly state the problem/opportunity, the major considerations, and the recommendation. Also, be clear about why you're sharing it with the other person (e.g., is it just for feedback or instead to have them make a final decision?).

8.  Prepare for changes as I go. Business cases that I've delved into for only 30 minutes have been readily scrapped as we realize that there is a major roadblock, or no real need. Other times, after a preliminary business case, we've realized that we could solve the same problem in a much easier way. Whatever the outcome, starting with a simple business case has been vital to helping along the journey of a good outcome!

## Businesses exist in a market

As we mentioned in Module 1, you should know the space - this includes your industry and direct and/or indirect competitors. While individual customer interactions can help expose learning at a micro-level, by going top-down and looking at the industry you can assess macro-level shifts and what they mean to your product and offering. For instance, Uber is racing to figure out self-driving cars because they realize how this new technology could both benefit or threaten their model, depending on how they approach it. Likewise, competition can be a great force for spurring innovation and while you don't want to over-obsess with what others are doing, turning a blind eye can be detrimental as you may miss major launches or realize their impact too late (e.g., case in point: [BlackBerry versus the iPhone](http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2015/05/26/blackberry-iphone-book/#3056ce4e4547)).

Long-story short, as a PM strive to:

### Know the industry
-   What are the fundamentals of your industry? What are the different forces driving the industry? (i.e., go back to first principles and evaluate how your industry works)
-   What are trends (e.g., changes in market size)?
-   How is technology playing a role?
-   Are there benchmarks or key metrics you need to know?

### Know the competition (both* [direct](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/direct-competitor) *and* [indirect](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/indirect-competition)*)

-   Who are they? What is their offering?
-   What are they good at? What are they not good at?
-   How are they doing? What do you think is on the horizon for them?
-   How do you stack up as a company and product offering? What are your competitive advantages?
-   How do customers perceive them versus your company/offering?

Ideally you'd keep up with industry trends all the time, and not just when developing a business case. Some easy suggestions for how to do so include: reading industry specific magazines for coverage of ongoing trends, setting-up Google alerts / emails digests for for topics of interest and competitors, listening to podcasts, etc. Another great way is to get your direct and extended teams into a habit of sharing external relevant news and articles.

## Business Models and the Business Model Canvas

A **business model** describes how an "organization creates, delivers, and captures value" [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model, Wikipedia - Business Model). Learn more about well-known business models [here](http://articles.bplans.co.uk/starting-a-business/examples-of-well-known-business-models/1040) and [here](http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2011/05/25/the-9-types-of-online-business-models-which-one-do-you-use/#gref).

Business models can be evaluated with many different frameworks. The **business model canvas** is a simple framework for you to get you quickly thinking about the major buckets a part of a company's business model. Watch this 2 minute video to learn about the framework:

## The simple questions you should know

Based on everything we've covered so far, it's important as a PM that you know the answers to the questions below for your company:

1.  How do you create value for customers?
2.  How do you deliver this value to customers?
3.  How do you capture value for the business?
4.  How has this value capture been trending across your company's offerings?

It will help you better understand the context of your company objectives, and also better ensure that you make product decisions factor in the way your company does business and tries to further its efforts.

Let's walk through an example for Intuit to answer each of these questions:

<br>
**1. How do you create value for customers?**

For example, at Intuit we had products that would create value for customers through benefits such as:

-   Time savings - E.g., Small businesses can save valuable time bookkeeping by using [QuickBooks Online](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/)
-   Money savings - E.g., Individuals can save money filing their taxes using [TurboTax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/)
-   Practice growth - E.g., Accountants can leverage the [ProAdvisor Program](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/accountants/proadvisor) to attract more clients

Beyond the benefits of individual products, there's an additional layer of value creation through the ongoing cultivation of the Intuit ecosystem, specifically through building several integrations between products so that customers can get even more benefit. For example, these integrations deliver value to Accountants that leverage [QuickBooks Online Accountant](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/accountant) to:
1.  Manage their own practice and their own accounting
2.  Work on their client's books which are on QuickBooks Online
3.  Employ the [Trial Balance](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/accountants/resources/tools-books-to-tax/) feature to ensure accounts are balanced
4.  Wrap up by completing a tax return through [Intuit Tax Online](https://taxpro.intuit.com/tax-online/).

<br>
**2. How do you deliver this value to customers?**

Building on the Intuit example, different approaches are taken depending on the product. For example, with a product such as QuickBooks Online, there's a multi-pronged approach. Small businesses primarily sign up for a subscription directly through the online website and are reached through both inbound (e.g., blog posts, social media campaigns, etc.) and outbound (e.g., paid web advertising, conferences, etc.) marketing efforts. Large accounting firms purchase bulk subscriptions for their clients by engaging with members of the Intuit Sales Team. Additionally, Accountants that use QuickBooks Online Accountant to manage their practice and clients’ books often act as champions for QuickBooks Online to their customers and help to drive its adoption. These are just some of the means by which Intuit is able to get QuickBooks Online to customers.

<br>
**3. How do you capture value for the business?**

Continuing on with our example, Intuit has over [30 products](https://www.intuit.com/products/), with many but not all directly contributing to the company's revenue and employing different models. For instance, QuickBooks Desktop is sold per user license while QuickBooks Online is subscription based. [Mint](https://www.mint.com) on the other hands is free for users but has generated revenue through means such as in-product referrals (i.e., Mint users sign-up for services promoted within the app) and ads (i.e., Mint sells ads space within the app), and fees on certain in-product bill payments. QuickBooks Online Accountant is free entirely but acts as channel to help drive new QuickBooks Online subscriptions as Accountants bring their clients onboard.

<br>
**4. How has this value capture been trending across your company's offerings?**

Taking a look at a single business unit at Intuit, say the Small Business Group which offers notable products such as [QuickBooks Desktop](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/premier/) and QuickBooks Online, you see some interesting trends. Taking a look at [quarterly reports](http://investors.intuit.com/financial-information/quarterly-reports/default.aspx), yes, as expected, online subscriptions are growing rapidly as there is a push in the industry towards the cloud. This push is motivated by customer benefit (access to data from anywhere, powerful integration with other complementary cloud-based products such as payroll and payments, etc.) as well as business benefit (e.g., a monthly subscription model creates much more predictable revenue, online allows easier cross-selling of complementary products). That said, for individuals not familiar with the space, you might think that no one uses desktop software anymore. In reality, Intuit has several million active QuickBooks Desktop customers and the number of new desktop sales are not falling off as quickly as one may expect [source](http://www.sleeter.com/blog/2014/10/quickbooks-online-and-quickbooks-desktop/, Sleeter - QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Desktop). One may think that to shift desktop customers to the cloud (QuickBooks Online), you should do away with desktop software entirely. But, by bringing in a balanced business and product perspective you realize that it's a stable and sizeable source of revenue, and a beloved product for many, so your business and product strategy should focus on maintenance and support for the foreseeable future.

## Optional frameworks and concepts

If the business frameworks so far have piqued your interest, below are a few more frameworks and concepts that may be of interest.
