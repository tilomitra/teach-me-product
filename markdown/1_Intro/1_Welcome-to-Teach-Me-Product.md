# Module 1 - Welcome to Teach Me Product

## The motivation behind Teach Me Product

[Marc Andreessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) famously claimed "[software is eating the world](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460)", and there's no doubt that software is becoming integral in many aspects of our lives. Behind the scenes, Product Managers (PMs) play a valuable role in building the software products that you know and love. Rightfully so, with the growing importance of software and the importance of PMs in the process, product management is more in-demand than ever! 

But while there's a lot of buzz around the craft...
-   Many don't know what PMs do
-   Those interested in breaking into product management don't know where to start
-   Those new to the field may not know what relevant fundamental topics they should learn in building their craft

I went through each of these stages myself and understand how difficult it is. I've also had many people reach out to me that are interested in learning more about what I do as a PM, and how they can break into the field. While there's many great books, articles, and blog posts that touch on different topics in the diverse space of product management - it's tough for those getting started to know what to focus on, and to learn core terms and concepts quickly. Teach Me Product was created for this reason - it's a free curated resource to help you learn the fundamentals of software product management!


## What is Teach Me Product

**Teach Me Product is a free curated resource aimed at educating those that want to learn more about software product management and the PM toolkit.** The site contains a collection of written modules focused on software product management that cover core, professional development, and supplementary topics. If you're a student or early career professional interested in learning more about product management, or a new PM who wants a starting point to fill-in some gaps in knowledge, this resource will help you get started. Modules contain original content written by myself and guest contributors specializing on topics, and are supplemented with leading resources from across the web.


## Who it's meant for

Teach Me Product is intended for two main audiences:

-   **Those interested in learning more about software product management** - perhaps you work with a PM and want to learn more about their role or you're interested in making the transition to becoming a PM yourself. Either way, the fundamentals covered will have you well on your way
-   **Early career PMs that want to take a structured approach to improving their craft** - Teach Me Product offers you a framework for the PM toolkit, and a starting point to fill in any gaps


## How to use it

Use this site however best it serves your learning needs. If you want to be thorough, you can go through it end-to-end; however, if you're comfortable on certain topics, jump straight into what you want to learn more about.

I'm a strong believer that learning happens through an iterative loop of theory, practice, and reflection. I encourage you to leverage Teach Me Product – and the resources referenced in it – to strengthen your understanding of product management. You should also apply your learning through building (nothing is too small!) and evaluating others' products to understand their ambitions and how you would improve things. Lastly, you should round this out by reflecting on your learning and grasp of concepts, and determining where you can further grow your understanding. Best of luck in your journey!


## Caveats

Before going through the modules, you should note the following:
-   **Teach Me Product focuses on software product management** - Most broadly, product management is the process of understanding customer/market needs and leading a product's development to deliver on the needs of its customers/users. Just like Tesla has product managers for its cars, Proctor and Gamble has product managers for laundry detergent, and Intuit has product managers for accounting software. As one might expect, managing product for a physical good (e.g., a car) is different than that for a hardware product (e.g., the Fitbit), which is different for a software product (e.g., Facebook).

-   **There is no "right" or "wrong" way to manage product** - The craft of product management is highly variable and as such it can be subjective. In modules, I present my own views and supplement them with additional resources. I share effective practices that I've come across and provide support with examples. I try my best to provide a balanced view on topics while also including my personal experiences. Different approaches may work for you; I encourage you to keep an open mind, learn, experiment, and see what works best for you.

-   **Terms may differ** - The terminology used across product organizations is different so don't be confused if your company refers to concepts with a different name.

-   **Frameworks and theory are included** - You often may not explicitly resort to them; however, they help you adopt a more holistic mindset to approach topics and problems, and understand at the highest level the important fundamentals of a topic. I know it can be a topic of contention, but I'm a firm believer that theory plays an important part in learning.


## About me

My name is Saksham Uppal and I **love** the craft of product management. I was recently a Product Manager at [Intuit](http://www.intuit.com/) - a leading financial software company based out of Silicon Valley and makers of notable products such as QuickBooks, Mint, and TurboTax - and also previously led product for my own startup. I'm passionate about learning and helping others in their own learning journey. Having interviewed and coached PMs, and helped others transition into product management, I realized the need for a curated resource and created Teach Me Product!
