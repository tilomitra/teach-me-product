# Module 1 - Welcome to Teach Me Product

## The motivation behind TMP

[Marc Andreessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) famously claimed "[software is eating the world](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460)". If software is eating the world, Product Managers (PMs) can be thought of as one the key chefs in the kitchen – and rightfully so, software product management is more in-demand than ever. While there's a lot of buzz around the craft many...
-   Don't know what PMs do
-   Those interested in breaking into product management don't know where to start
-   Those new to the field may not know what relevant fundamental topics they should learn in building their craft

I went through each of these stages myself and understand how difficult it is. I've also had many people reach out to me who are interested in learning more about what I do as a PM, and how they can break into the field. After trying to find resources to help them get started, I found many gaps. There are several blog posts and books on product but most focus only on specific topics. When you're starting off, it's hard to know what you should cover and what you should take with a grain of salt. Teach Me Product (TMP) was created for this reason - it's a free curated resource to help you learn the fundamentals of software product management! TMP includes original content written by myself, with input from Product Managers across top software companies, and supplemented with resources across the web.


## What is TMP

TMP is a collection of written modules focused on software product management that cover core, professional development, advanced, and supplementary topics. Modules contain original content written by myself, with input from Product Managers across top software companies, and are supplemented with resources across the web.


## Who TMP is meant for

TMP is intended for two main audiences:

-   Those interested in learning more about software product management - perhaps you work with a PM and want to learn more about their role or you're interested in making the transition to becoming a PM yourself. Either way, the fundamentals covered will have you well on your way
-   Early career PMs that want to take a structured approach to improving their craft. TMP offers you a framework for the PM toolkit, and a starting point to fill in any gaps


## How to use TMP

Use TMP however best it serves your learning needs. If you want to be thorough, you can go through it end-to-end; however, if you're comfortable on certain topics, jump straight into what you want to learn more about!

I'm a strong believer that learning happens through an iterative loop of theory, practice, and reflection. I encourage you to leverage TMP – and the resources referenced in it – to strengthen your understanding of product management. You should also apply your learning through building (nothing is too small!) and evaluating others' products to understand their efforts and how you would improve things. Lastly, you should round this out by reflecting on your progress - what are strengths, what are your weaknesses, and how can you take your efforts further? Best of luck in your journey!


## Caveats

Before going through TMP, you should note the following:
-   __TMP focuses on software product management__ - Most broadly, product management is the process of understanding customer/market needs and leading a product's development to deliver on the needs of its customers/users. Just like Tesla has product managers for its cars, Proctor and Gamble has product managers for laundry detergent, and Intuit has product managers for accounting software. As one might expect, managing product for a physical good (e.g., a car) is different than that for a hardware product (e.g., the Fitbit), which is different for a software product (e.g., Facebook).

-   __There is no "right" or "wrong" way to manage product__ - The craft of product management is highly variable and as such it can be subjective. In TMP, I present my own views and supplement them with additional resources. I share effective practices that I've come across and provide support with examples. I try my best to provide a balanced view on topics while also including my personal experiences. Different approaches may work for you; I encourage you to keep an open mind, learn, experiment, and see what works best for you.

-   __Terms may differ__ - The terminology used across product organizations is different so don't be confused if your company refers to concepts with a different name.

-   __Frameworks and theory are included__ - You often may not explicitly resort to them; however, they help you adopt a more holistic mindset to approach topics and problems, and understand at the highest level the important fundamentals of a topic. I know it can be a topic of contention, but I'm a firm believer that theory plays an important part in learning.


## About me

My name is Saksham Uppal and I **love** the craft of product management. I was recently a Product Manager at [Intuit](http://www.intuit.com/) - a leading financial software company based out of Silicon Valley and makers of notable products such as QuickBooks, Mint, and TurboTax - and also previously led product for my own startup. I'm passionate about learning and helping others in their own learning journey. Having interviewed and coached PMs, and helped others transition into product management, I realized the need for a curated resource and created Teach Me Product!
